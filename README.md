<h1> RAILWAY RESERVATION PROJECT </h1>

This is a school project. 
The main files in this project are <code><b>app.py</b></code>, <code><b>index.html</b></code>, <code><b>style.css</b></code>.


The project sparked new interest in me to build beautiful ui with working backend which has some practical real life application. 
My view with this project is to apply some of the really good options that the airline industry provides to its users into the railways. The main things I wanted to implement are :
1)  Giving the traveller an option to choose his seat as in Indian Railways currently a person is alloted a seat by the system and cannot be selected by the person. 
2)  Somehow implementing a way to provide trains according to the persons needs, show the seat available from all places the trains have their stops.
3)  Add a way to avail connecting trains from one place to another. 

This projects main motto at its start was to improve the occupancy of the trains and also provide versatility to the user in selecting the seat of their choice. 

The idea behind this project came from my own experiences that i had travelling on Trains.

<h3>Libraries and Modules</h3>
Flask - it is a python web framework used for connecting the python backend with the HTML+CSS frontend

<br>
Sqlite - for this project it is used as an integrated database in the python code to make the app run smoother and easy to write code.

This project has just begun, there is more coming to it and the UI is just the first iteration and will get more interesting and intiutive to use and accessible to all. And also more features are to be implemented which are quite ambitious for my scale and skill level but will definitely learn though the process just as i learnt a little of Flask, Sqlite Database and Javascript. Very excited for the future updates.
